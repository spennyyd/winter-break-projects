# Projects for Winter Break 2020

This is an active repository where we will upload general programming problems for you to work on over the winter break.
These problems will be language neutral (so you can complete them in any language), but we might recommend certain languages so that you can get experience working in them.

## Instructions
1. Start by forking the repository (click the button that says fork) so that you will have a custom version to work on.
2. Clone that forked repository to your own computer.
3. Add your solution to that problem's folder and then send a message on our Discord server for your solution to get reviewed.
4. Check back weekly for solutions and new problems!
